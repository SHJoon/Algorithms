# Threes and Fives
# Create function ThreesFives() that adds each value from 100 and 4000000 (inclusive) if that value
# is evenly divisible by 3 or 5 but not both. Display the final sum in the console.
# Second: Change your function to make a BetterThreesFives(start,end)where start and end
# values are customizable. You can think of the above ThreesFives() function as
# BetterThreesFives(100,4000000).
