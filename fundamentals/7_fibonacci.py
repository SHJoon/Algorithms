# Fibonacci
# Implement the Fibonacci function, a famous mathematical equation that
# generates a numerical sequence such that each number is the sum of the
# previous two. The Fibonacci numbers at index 0 and 1, coincidentally, have
# values of 0 and 1. Your function should accept an argument of which Fibonacci number.
# Examples: fibonacci(2) = 1, fibonacci(3) = 2, fibonacci(4) = 3, fibonacci(5) = 5, etc.
